-------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS FIRMWARE CURRENTLY HAS A YET-TO-IMPLEMENT CLOCK FUNCTIONALITY,
SO IT WONT DISPLAY TIME PROPERLY, WONT WAKE YOU UP IN THE MORNING,
AND WILL MAKE YOUR GIRLFRIEND DUMP YOU!

You have been warned!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the fun part.


== Status ==

Works,... But full of hacks.

== Requirements ==

msp430-gcc4 http://mspgcc4.sourceforge.net/
make
python http://python.org


== HOWTO ==

* Copy gcc/intrinsics.h into [msp430-gcc-path]/msp430/include/intrinsics.h

* To configure your image, run:
   $ make config 

which will generate a config.h file that contains the settings for your build.

* To compile the image run:
   $ make

* To flash the image:
   $ cd ControlCenter
   $ ./truong-CC.tcl
   (NOTE: The stock Control Panel won't work with this firmware. 
   The time struc when syncing on this firmware is different from the stock.
   This is a genuine truong_epoch implementation, not the lame 
   if hour=23 && minute==59 && second==59 then day+=1 implementation. :-)
 Use the Wireless Update function to update the firmware, as usual.
 
 
* Sync time: 
   1 Go to Simplicity Sync Tab, Click Start Access Point.
   2 Get your watch to sync mode, push the down (v) button to sync.
   3 Now click Set Watch (click twice if you're getting desperate)
   4 Click Read Watch, twice if failed, it should say something ....0xFF.
   5 If fail, try step 3 & 4 again, it's kind of unreliable. 
   You can blame me on many things, but don't blame me on this. Not my fault.
   
* NOTE: This firmware "locks" wireless update by default, so you have to push
the down (v) button once to unlock, then hold # to start wireless update again.
   
* Enjoy your watchfob!
