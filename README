Do not sue me if this firmware makes you mad.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

== Status ==

Works,... 

== You don't have to compile anymore! ==

Now just flash the firmware with whatever software you have,
Then do python3 sync.py, you should be set.

The pre-built firmware can be downloaded from:
http://tnhh.net/chronos-otp

== Requirements ==

msp430-gcc4 http://mspgcc4.sourceforge.net/
make
python http://python.org
python3

== HOWTO ==

* Copy gcc/intrinsics.h into [msp430-gcc-path]/msp430/include/intrinsics.h

* To configure your image, run:
   $ make config 

which will generate a config.h file that contains the settings for your build.

* To compile the image run:
   $ make

* To flash the image: Use any flasher that you are using.
  Use the Wireless Update function to update the firmware, as usual.
 
* Sync time:
  python3 sync.py TIMEZONE 16CHARSKEY
 
* NOTE: This firmware "locks" wireless update by default, so you have to push
the down (v) button once to unlock, then hold # to start wireless update again.
   
* Enjoy your watchfob!
